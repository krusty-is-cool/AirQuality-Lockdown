# AirQuality-Lockdown
The effect of the Lockdown on Paris Air Quality

During Covid-19 Crisis, France has been under lockdown from 17 March to 11 May 2020. Road traffic has been reduced to its minimum.
As a consequence, it's a unique opportunity to study air pollutants data and to compare with previous years.

The study consists in a Python Jupyter Notebook.

A small [article](https://github.com/krusty-is-cool/AirQuality-Lockdown/article.md) with more details is also available in french.
